Assumptions made by the build system (which should be fixed, as soon as I can
figure out the right options to make Ant run with gcj).

The build system assumes that ant can be called; in a later phase, autoconf
should check for the executable.

The build system assumes the presence of 'java' and 'javac' executables.
